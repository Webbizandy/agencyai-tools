  "description": "Sales CRM built for closing deals. Visual pipeline, activity reminders, and forecasting that actually helps.",
  "longDescription": "**What it does:** CRM designed specifically for sales teams. Drag-and-drop pipeline view shows you every deal, what stage it's in, and what needs to happen to close it.\n\n**Why it matters:** Most CRMs are built for marketers. Pipedrive is built for closers. If your job is booking calls and signing clients, this keeps you focused on the deals that matter.\n\n**Who it's for:** Agencies with active sales teams, consultants managing multiple prospects at once, or anyone who lives and dies by their close rate.\n\n**Andy's notes:** I love the visual pipeline. You can see at a glance which deals are stuck, which ones need follow-up, and which ones are about to close. The activity reminders keep you from dropping balls. Only downside? It's not great for marketing automation \u2014 you'll need something else for that.",
