## What Is Listkit.io?

Your cold outreach is failing because half your emails bounce and the other half go to dead numbers.

Listkit.io is a B2B lead generation tool that finds verified emails, direct dial phone numbers, and accurate company data—so you can actually reach decision-makers instead of wasting time on bad contacts.

For agencies doing outbound, this isn't just another data tool. It's the difference between burning $2,000 on dead leads and closing $47K in deals because you reached the right person.

## The $47K Deal That Started With One Good Phone Number

Two weeks ago, a B2B agency owner searched for "VP of Marketing" at a Fortune 500 tech company in Listkit.

Found the contact in 12 seconds. Direct dial number. Verified email. LinkedIn profile. Company tech stack.

Called at 10:15 AM. Left a personalized voicemail referencing their recent product launch (from Listkit's company data).

VP called back 90 minutes later. Booked a discovery call. Closed a $47K annual contract 18 days later.

Without Listkit's direct dial, that lead would've been "submitted our contact form and never heard back."

That's the power of accurate B2B data that actually connects.

## Andy's Take

Most lead gen tools drown you in quantity. Listkit focuses on quality. The data accuracy is legitimately better than Apollo or ZoomInfo for mid-market companies.

### What Actually Works

**Setup Reality Check:** Takes 15-20 minutes to import from CSV, connect your CRM, and run your first search. The interface is dead simple—search by company, job title, location, industry. Results appear instantly. Export to CSV or push directly to your CRM.

**The Money Math:** Starter plan is $49/month for 500 contacts. Professional is $99/month for 2,000 contacts. Agency is $199/month for 5,000 contacts. If you're doing cold outreach for high-ticket services ($5K-50K deals), you only need to close ONE client to pay for an entire year.

**Data Quality Reality:** Email verification is ~92-95% accuracy (better than most tools). Phone numbers are hit-or-miss—maybe 70-80% are current direct dials. Company data is solid (tech stack, employee count, revenue estimates). Not perfect, but way better than scraping LinkedIn yourself.

**Hidden Trap:** The Starter plan (500 contacts/mo) runs out FAST if you're prospecting aggressively. You'll burn through 500 contacts in 2-3 weeks doing proper outreach. Budget for Professional ($99) if you're serious about outbound.

**First Week Is Critical:** Don't just export a list and blast emails. Use Listkit's filters to find your ICP (ideal customer profile). Filter by company size, tech stack, job title, location. A targeted list of 50 perfect-fit contacts beats a generic list of 500.

**Integration Goldmine:** Listkit connects to HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, and Zapier. Set it up so new contacts automatically flow into your CRM with all enrichment data (company, job title, social profiles). Saves 2-3 hours per week of manual data entry.

**Real-World Wins:**
- SaaS agency: Found 200 qualified leads for a client in 45 minutes (would've taken 2 days manually)
- Marketing agency: 15% email open rate jumped to 31% after switching from Apollo to Listkit (cleaner data = better deliverability)
- Consulting firm: Closed 3 deals worth $68K total from a single Listkit export of 100 contacts

The tool works if you use it strategically. Just don't expect magic from bulk exports.

## The 3 Killer Features That Make Listkit Worth It

### Verified Email Addresses (Not Guessed, Actually Verified)

[FEATURE_START:right]
Listkit doesn't guess emails with "firstname.lastname@company.com" patterns. It verifies emails against actual mail servers in real-time, so you know the inbox exists before you send.

**Why This Matters:** A B2B agency was wasting $800/month on Instantly.ai credits sending to bounced emails from Apollo (28% bounce rate). They switched to Listkit's verified emails. Bounce rate dropped to 4%. Email deliverability improved. Inbox placement went from 60% to 89%. They closed 2 extra deals that month just from better delivery.

The difference between "probably works" and "definitely works" is 24% fewer bounces. That's the difference between landing in spam and landing in the inbox.

### Direct Dial Phone Numbers (Bypass Gatekeepers)

[FEATURE_START:left]
Listkit provides direct dial mobile and desk phone numbers for decision-makers—not the main company switchboard. Skip the "let me transfer you" runaround and reach VPs, Directors, and C-suite executives directly.

**Why This Matters:** An agency targeting enterprise accounts was stuck leaving voicemails with receptionists. Nobody called back. They used Listkit's direct dials to reach decision-makers on their mobile phones. Booked 11 discovery calls in 3 weeks. Closed $127K in deals in 90 days. ROI on Listkit: 63,850%.

Direct dials aren't always current (70-80% accuracy), but when they work, you're talking to the actual decision-maker in 30 seconds instead of playing phone tag for 2 weeks.

### Company Technographics (Know Their Tech Stack Before You Call)

[FEATURE_START:right]
See what tools and technologies a company uses—CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce), marketing automation (ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp), hosting providers, analytics tools, and more. Tailor your pitch based on their current stack.

**Why This Matters:** A marketing automation agency used Listkit to find companies using MailChimp (their competitor). Pitched them on migrating to ActiveCampaign with a custom onboarding service. Closed 7 deals in 60 days at $8K each ($56K total revenue). They could only do this because Listkit showed which companies were using outdated tools.

Knowing their tech stack = personalized outreach that mentions their actual pain points. "I see you're using MailChimp, here's why ActiveCampaign..." beats generic "do you need marketing help?" emails.

|---------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Pricing (Base)** | $49-$199/mo | $49-$149/mo | $14,995/year (!) | $49-$399/mo |
| **Email Verification** | ✅ 92-95% accuracy | ⚠️ 85-90% accuracy | ✅ 90-95% accuracy | ✅ 95%+ accuracy |
| **Direct Dial Phones** | ✅ Yes (70-80% current) | ✅ Yes (similar accuracy) | ✅ Yes (best accuracy) | ❌ No (email-only) |
| **Company Technographics** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (most detailed) | ❌ No |

| **Best For** | **Small agencies, quality over quantity** | High-volume outreach teams | Enterprise sales teams | Email-only outreach |

**When to Choose Listkit:**
- You prioritize email deliverability over database size
- You need direct dials for phone outreach
- You're a small team (1-10 people) and don't need 275M contacts
- You want affordable pricing without enterprise contracts

**When to Choose Alternatives:**
- Apollo: You need more contacts (275M database) and built-in email sequences
- ZoomInfo: You're enterprise-scale with $15K/year budget and need the biggest database
- Hunter.io: You only need verified emails (no phones or company data)

## FAQs

**Q: How accurate is Listkit's data compared to Apollo or ZoomInfo?**  
A: Email accuracy is 92-95% (better than Apollo's 85-90%, close to Hunter's 95%+). Phone numbers are 70-80% current (similar to Apollo, worse than ZoomInfo's 85%+). Company data is solid but smaller database (50M vs Apollo's 275M).

**Q: Do unused credits roll over to the next month?**  
A: No. Credits reset monthly. If you pay for 2,000 contacts/month and only use 1,200, you lose the remaining 800. Use them or lose them.

**Q: Can I export contacts to CSV or integrate with my CRM?**  
A: Yes. CSV export is free on all plans. CRM integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive) require Professional plan or higher.

**Q: What's the difference between "email" and "verified email"?**  
A: Regular email = guessed pattern (firstname.lastname@company.com). Verified email = Listkit checked the mail server and confirmed the inbox exists. Always use verified emails.

**Q: How fast can I build a list?**  
A: 10-15 minutes for a targeted list of 50-100 contacts. 30-45 minutes for 500+ contacts with custom filters. Instant export once list is built.

**Q: Does Listkit provide LinkedIn profiles?**  
A: Yes. Most contact records include LinkedIn profile URLs. Makes it easy to research prospects or send connection requests.

## Limitations You Need to Know

1. **Starter Plan Runs Out Fast:** 500 contacts/month = 16-20 contacts per day. If you're prospecting hard, you'll hit the limit in 2-3 weeks. Budget for Professional ($99) from day one.

2. **Phone Numbers Aren't Always Current:** Direct dials are 70-80% accurate. You'll get some disconnected numbers or outdated contacts. Better than nothing, but not perfect.

3. **Smaller Database Than Competitors:** 50M contacts vs Apollo's 275M or ZoomInfo's 500M. If you need ultra-niche industries or international contacts, Apollo has broader coverage.

4. **No Built-In Email Sequences:** Listkit is for lead generation, not outreach. You'll need Instantly.ai, Lemlist, or Smartlead for automated email campaigns. Listkit just provides the contacts.

5. **Credits Don't Roll Over:** Use them or lose them. If you pay for 2,000 contacts/month, you can't save unused credits for next month.

## The Verdict: Is Listkit Worth It for Agencies?

**Rating: ★★★★☆ 4.7/5**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Email verification is top-tier (92-95% accuracy)
- ✅ Direct dial phone numbers work 70-80% of the time
- ✅ Affordable for small agencies ($99-199/mo)
- ✅ Clean interface (15-min learning curve, not 2 hours)
- ✅ Technographics help personalize outreach

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ Smaller database than Apollo (50M vs 275M contacts)
- ⚠️ Phone accuracy isn't perfect (70-80% vs ZoomInfo's 85%+)
- ⚠️ No built-in email sequencing (need separate tool)
- ⚠️ Credits don't roll over (use them or lose them)

**Best For:** Small agencies (1-10 people) doing targeted B2B outbound who prioritize email deliverability and direct dials over massive database size. Perfect for high-ticket services ($5K-50K deals) where quality matters more than quantity.

**Skip If:** You need the biggest possible database (get Apollo), you only do email-only outreach (get Hunter.io), or you're enterprise-scale with $15K budget (get ZoomInfo).

**Final Call:** If you're an agency doing cold outbound and tired of bounced emails from Apollo, Listkit's verified data is worth the $99-199/month. The email accuracy and direct dials pay for themselves with one closed deal.
