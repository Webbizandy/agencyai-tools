# GoHighLevel Review: 3 Years In, Here's What Nobody Tells You

*By Andy Kelly - Using it since 2022 with 12+ clients*

## The $2,100/Month Wake-Up Call

It was 2022.

I was staring at my credit card statement and doing math I really didn't want to do.

Infusionsoft (or Keap, whatever they're calling it now): $299  
Kartra for funnels: $199  
Wistia for video: $99  
Aweber for some campaigns: $49  
Zapier Pro to make it all talk: $49  
Make.com for the complex stuff: $29  
Acuity for calendars: $34  
ClickFunnels for landing pages: $297  

Plus a bunch of other tools I'm probably forgetting.

**Total damage: Over $2,100 a month.**

For what? The privilege of flipping between six different tabs, chasing down broken Zapier connections, and wondering why the hell my automation didn't fire at 2am.

The worst part wasn't even the money.

It was the constant babysitting.

"Did Infusionsoft sync with the calendar?"  
"Why isn't this funnel triggering the email sequence?"  
"Great, Zapier's down again."

I was spending more time being a systems admin than running my agency.

Then I found GoHighLevel.

Or rather, it found me.

---

## How I Discovered GHL (Thanks Matt)

I was in a database reactivation group—one of those "let's squeeze gold from dead leads" programs.

The guy running it was Matt. Never really sold before, barely knew what he was doing with agencies.

But he'd set up this whole system in GoHighLevel.

Everything pre-configured. Automations ready to go. Training included.

And here's the kicker: While the rest of us experienced agency owners were still "planning our approach" and "strategizing," Matt was out there closing $5K-$10K deals within weeks.

He just... did it.

I'm watching this guy who's brand new to the game land high-ticket clients faster than people who'd been doing it for years.

What was different?

He wasn't juggling six tools. He had ONE platform.

That got my attention.

## TL;DR - The Bottom Line

**MY SETUP:**
- **Using it since:** 2022 (3 years)
- **Plan:** Agency Pro White Label ($497/mo)
- **What I was spending before:** $2,100+/mo across 8+ tools
- **Active clients on it:** 12
- **What I charge clients:** $397-$2,000/mo depending on services
- **Setup time per client:** First one took weeks. Now? 1 hour.

**WHO IT'S FOR:**
✅ Agencies doing automation campaigns (database reactivation, lead nurture)  
✅ If you're managing multiple clients with CRM/pipeline needs  
✅ When you want white-label revenue ($397/client/mo on $497/mo cost)  
✅ Service business clients (real estate, HVAC, contractors, etc.)

**SKIP IT IF:**
❌ You only need basic email follow-up (too much tool)  
❌ You're just starting and have <3 clients (start at $97/mo tier)  
❌ You need world-class email marketing (dedicated tools are better)  
❌ You hate learning curves (first month is rough)

**MY RATING: 4.6/5**
- Would be 5/5 if the email system was as good as GetResponse
- And if I'd known about the MVO approach from day one

## Week One Was... Rough

Look, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.

That first week, I was excited AND overwhelmed.

Excited because: Everything's under one roof. Finally.

Overwhelmed because: Holy crap, there's a LOT here.

Now, I'd been using Infusionsoft for years, so I wasn't scared of complex CRMs. But GHL is different. It's not just a CRM. It's CRM + email + SMS + funnels + websites + calendars + courses + memberships + automations + AI agents.

They say "10-minute setup."

That's... a stretch.

If by setup you mean "get a sub-account created with basic business info," sure. Ten minutes.

But actually having something READY? With automations, copy, workflows, sequences?

First client took me weeks. I'm talking proper setup time, not just clicking "create account."

Now? One hour. Because I've got templates and I know what I'm doing.

**The learning curve is real.**

But here's the thing...

---

## When Everything Clicked

We set up our first database reactivation campaign for a real estate agent.

These were "dead" leads. Worked over extensively. The kind of list you'd normally throw away.

We loaded them into GHL, set up the text message sequences, added the email follow-ups, connected the booking calendar.

Hit start.

Within 48 hours, we had responses coming in.

Not "stop texting me" responses (though we got those too).

Real responses. "Tell me more." "When can we talk?" "I'm ready to sell."

Leads that were considered GONE started booking calls with the agent.

Some turned into listings. Then sales.

That's when everything clicked for me.

This wasn't just consolidating tools. This was a system that actually WORKED.

And it would've taken me days to build this with my old stack of Infusionsoft + Zapier + Make + ClickFunnels + Acuity.

In GHL? Couple hours to set up. Then it ran itself.

---

## What I Actually Use Every Day (After 3 Years)

Forget the fancy features in the sales videos.

Here's what I'm in every single day:

### 1. **Sales Pipelines**
Not sexy. Super useful.

Every lead, every client, every opportunity—tracked in one place. Can see exactly where everything is, what needs to happen next, and set up automations to nudge things along.

Before GHL, I was using spreadsheets and hoping I didn't forget to follow up with someone. Now? The system reminds ME.

### 2. **Billing System**
Getting paid is important. GHL handles it.

Recurring billing for white-label clients. One less thing to manage separately.

### 3. **Automations (The Real MVP)**
This is where GHL shines.

Database reactivation. Lead nurture. SMS sequences. Email follow-ups. Booking confirmations. All triggered automatically based on actions.

The automation builder is visual. Drag and drop. "When this happens, do that."

Could I build this with Zapier? Sure. But I'd need 47 Zaps and pray nothing breaks.

In GHL, it's all in one place. All talking to each other. No API keys to manage.

### 4. **Training & Membership Tools**
Not as robust as dedicated platforms like Kajabi or Teachable.

But good enough? Absolutely.

I've built courses, memberships, and community groups inside GHL. Everything stays in the ecosystem. Client logs in once, accesses everything.

### 5. **Email System**
Here's where I'll be honest...

GHL's email system works. But it's not GetResponse or ActiveCampaign.

Deliverability is fine. Features are there. But if you're doing heavy email marketing with complex segmentation and A/B testing, dedicated tools are better.

For most agency use cases (follow-up sequences, client communication, basic campaigns), it's perfectly fine.

Trade-off: You get "good enough" email in exchange for everything else being connected.

---

## What Looked Amazing But I Never Use

### The Built-In AI Agent System

GHL has AI agents built in now.

Sounds cool. I don't use them.

Why? Because I use CloseBot (formerly ZappyChat) for all my booking bots and AI agents.

That's ALL they do. They're specialists. And they're damn good at it.

GHL's AI is handy to have. But if AI agents are critical to your client delivery (like they are for me), you want a dedicated tool.

It's like having a Swiss Army knife vs. a chef's knife. The Swiss Army knife HAS a blade. But if you're cooking, you want the chef's knife.

---

## My Favorite Hidden Feature

The ClickFunnels importer.

Nobody talks about this. But it saved me HOURS.

I had a bunch of clients on ClickFunnels. Pages, funnels, entire sequences built over years.

GHL has an importer that pulls all of that directly into the system. Automatically converts everything.

One click. Everything migrated.

That ONE feature made the transition from ClickFunnels so much easier.

If you've got ClickFunnels stuff you need to move, this is gold.

---

## The Real Estate Agent Story

My favorite client success is probably that first real estate group.

They had multiple agents. Each had lead lists they'd worked to death.

The agents were making calls. Leaving voicemails. Sending emails manually. Not getting responses.

They were ready to throw these lists away.

We took those lists, loaded them into GHL, and set up our database reactivation system.

Text message sequences (written specifically for real estate). Email follow-ups. Booking calendar for calls.

Hit start.

48 hours later: Responses flooding in.

Over the next few weeks: Multiple listings booked. Several closed sales.

From leads they thought were DEAD.

The agents were over the moon.

And the system ran itself. Once it was set up, it just... worked.

That's when I knew GHL was the real deal.

---

## When GHL Doesn't Work

Not every client was a success story.

I had two clients where we integrated AI booking agents for phone calls. Lead calls in, AI agent qualifies them and books appointments.

Should've been perfect.

But the AI kept making mistakes. Not major ones, but enough to frustrate the clients.

I kept updating the training. Tweaking the prompts. Adjusting the workflow.

They weren't happy with how the AI responded on calls. Something about the flow just didn't click for their specific use case.

Eventually, we parted ways.

**Lesson learned:** GHL's AI is improving, but if your entire value prop is phone-based AI agents, you might need dedicated tools like CloseBot that do ONLY that.

---

## The Money Part (Let's Talk Real Numbers)

This is where it gets interesting.

**What I pay:** $497/mo (Agency Pro White Label)

**What I charge clients:** 
- Basic white-label setup: $397/mo
- Full done-for-you marketing: $1,500-$2,000/mo

**Quick math:**
- 5 clients at $397/mo = $1,985/mo revenue
- My cost = $497/mo
- Profit = $1,488/mo

That's just for giving them access to "their CRM platform."

Then you add done-for-you services on top.

**Setup time per client (NOW):**
- 1 hour for basic setup (I have templates)
- 2-3 hours for custom copy (texts, emails, sequences)
- Total: One afternoon per new client

**First client took:** Weeks. Because I was figuring it out.

**Ongoing support:** Barely any.

Here's why: I use Extendly for white-label support.

They handle all client questions, onboarding, and troubleshooting. Looks like it's coming from my agency. I don't touch it.

Cost: Way less than hiring someone. Worth every penny.

So the actual maintenance? Maybe 30 minutes per client per month. And that's just checking in, making sure automations are running smooth.

**This is the white-label dream everyone talks about.**

And it's real. But only if you set it up right from the start.

---

## What I Used Before (And Why It Sucked)

Here's my old stack:

**CRM & Email:** Infusionsoft/Keap  
- Good automation. Expensive. Hadn't updated much in years.
- Couldn't keep up with what GHL was adding.

**Funnels:** Kartra and ClickFunnels  
- Both solid. But separate from CRM.
- Integration = Zapier = things breaking randomly.

**SMS:** Infusionsoft had it, barely used it  
- Expensive per message. Clunky interface.

**Calendars:** Acuity  
- Great tool! But separate login, separate billing, separate everything.
- Connecting to CRM = Zapier (again).

**Automations:** Zapier and Make  
- When they work, they're magic.
- When they break at 2am, you want to throw your laptop.

**The problem?**

Too many moving parts.

Even though Infusionsoft was solid, GHL's automation and integration is just BETTER.

And having everything hooked together natively—no Zapier, no API keys, no "why isn't this syncing?"—changes everything.

I haven't been tempted to switch away from GHL.

The only time I thought about it was for email. But where would I go? Back to managing six tools?

Not happening.

---

## What Frustrates Me (After 3 Years)

### Early Days: AI Integration Hell

When I first started using the AI agents, they'd break. Constantly.

Training wouldn't stick. Responses would be weird. Things would just... stop working.

This was early 2022-2023 though. ChatGPT was new. Everyone was figuring it out.

It's MUCH better now. But those first few months were rough.

### Current Frustration: Email System

It works. But it's not GetResponse or ActiveCampaign.

For basic campaigns and sequences, it's fine. For heavy email marketing with complex segmentation, A/B testing, and advanced deliverability features, dedicated tools are better.

Trade-off is: You get "good enough" email in exchange for everything else being native.

### Biggest Mistake New Users Make (That I Made Too)

Trying to do too much, too fast.

I call it the MVO approach now: **Minimum Viable Option.**

Start simple. One automation. One campaign. Get THAT working.

Then add the next piece.

Don't try to migrate your entire business and all your clients in week one.

That's what I did. And it was overwhelming.

If I could go back, I'd start with ONE client. Get them fully set up and running smooth. THEN add the next.

## Who Should Actually Use GHL

### **Perfect For:**

**Agencies doing automation campaigns**  
Database reactivation, lead nurture, multi-step sequences—this is where GHL shines.

**Managing multiple clients**  
Sub-accounts, white-label branding, centralized billing. Built for agencies.

**Service business clients**  
Real estate, HVAC, contractors, dentists, lawyers. GHL's features align perfectly with their needs.

**Anyone tired of tool juggling**  
If you're currently managing 6+ tools and you're sick of integrations breaking, GHL consolidates it.

### **Wrong Choice If:**

**You only need basic email follow-up**  
GHL is too much tool. Start with something simple.

**You're brand new with <3 clients**  
Start at the $97/mo tier. Don't pay for Agency Pro until you need it.

**You need world-class email marketing**  
If email is 80% of your business, dedicated tools like ActiveCampaign are better.

**You hate learning curves**  
First month is rough. If you need plug-and-play instantly, this isn't it.

---

## The Recommendation

If I had a mate starting an agency tomorrow, here's what I'd tell them:

**Start with GHL at the $97/mo tier.**

Not the $497 Agency Pro. Just the basic plan.

Get ONE client set up. Learn the platform. Build your first automation.

Once that's working and you've got 3-5 clients, THEN upgrade to Agency Pro and go white-label.

Don't try to boil the ocean on day one.

**Would I choose GHL again if I could go back 3 years?**

Absolutely.

But I'd keep it simpler at the start. One client at a time. Minimum viable option.

The platform itself? No regrets.

It consolidated $2,100/mo of tools into $497/mo.  
It gives me white-label revenue I didn't have before.  
It saves me hours every week not babysitting integrations.

And after 3 years, I still haven't found anything that does what GHL does.

## Quick Hits (Rapid Fire Answers)

**Best part of GHL in one sentence:**  
Everything talks to everything, natively, without Zapier breaking at 2am.

**Worst part in one sentence:**  
Email system is "good enough" but not great if you're an email-heavy business.

**Biggest surprise after 3 years:**  
How much they keep adding—Voice AI, better automations, more integrations. It never stops improving.

**One thing I'd tell myself 3 years ago:**  
Start with ONE client. Master that. Then scale. Don't try to migrate everyone at once.

**White-label revenue - real or overhyped?**  
REAL. 5 clients at $397/mo = $1,985/mo on $497/mo cost. Do the math.

**The Voice AI everyone's raving about - you use it?**  
Not GHL's. I use CloseBot because that's ALL they do. But GHL's AI is solid for basic use.

---

## Getting Started (If You Decide to Try It)

**Step 1:** Sign up for the $97/mo plan (not Agency Pro yet)

**Step 2:** Pick ONE client or ONE campaign to start with  
Don't migrate your whole business. Start small.

**Step 3:** Use templates (they have tons in the marketplace)  
Don't build from scratch. Find a template close to what you need and customize.

**Step 4:** Join a GHL community or course  
The official training is OK. But communities have the real-world shortcuts.

**Step 5:** Get your first client's campaign WORKING  
Fully working. Not "mostly set up." Actually running and getting results.

**Step 6:** THEN add your next client  
Repeat the process. Build your template library as you go.

**Step 7:** Once you hit 3-5 clients, upgrade to Agency Pro  
That's when white-label makes sense. Not before.

## Final Thoughts

GoHighLevel isn't perfect.

The email system could be better. The learning curve is real. The AI features are improving but not best-in-class yet.

But here's the thing...

After 3 years and 12 clients, I can't imagine going back to the old way.

Managing six different tools. Zapier breaking at random. Chasing down why something didn't sync.

No thanks.

GHL consolidated my stack. Gave me white-label revenue. And gave me hours back every week.

If you're an agency owner managing multiple clients with automation needs, it's worth the learning curve.

Just don't try to boil the ocean on day one.

Start small. Build smart. Scale when you're ready.
