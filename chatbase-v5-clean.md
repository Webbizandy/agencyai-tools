## What Is ChatBase?

Your clients email you the same questions every week. Your support team answers the same tickets daily. You're paying people to repeat themselves.

ChatBase turns your documents, FAQs, and website content into an AI chatbot that answers questions instantly—24/7, in 80+ languages—while you focus on deals that actually grow your business.

## The $2,400/Month Client Call Nobody Expected

Last Tuesday at 11:47 PM, a landscaping agency owner called one of Andy's clients. Frantic.

"We just lost a $60K commercial contract because we missed 47 calls during install season. Can you help?"

They deployed a ChatBase bot in 90 minutes. Within two weeks, the landscaping company captured 15-20 after-hours leads. They converted 40% into sales—6-8 new jobs per month they would have lost forever.

The agency now charges that client $1,200/month for a tool that costs them $69.

That's the power of white-label AI support done right.

## Andy's Take

Most agencies sell ChatBase wrong. They pitch "AI chatbot" and clients yawn. The real money is in positioning it as **"Your 24/7 Support Team That Never Sleeps"**—then proving ROI in the first 30 days.

### What Actually Works

**Setup Reality Check:** Takes 90 minutes total—upload docs, customize branding, embed widget. Your first client pays for itself in week one.

**The Money Math:** You pay $138/month for two white-labeled chatbots. Charge clients $500-$1,500/month each. If you land just 5 clients, you're banking $3,612/month profit. Scale to 10? $8,112/month. All recurring revenue.

**Hidden Trap:** The free tier is useless. AppSumo "lifetime deals" cap your client count. Go straight to the Standard plan ($99/mo) + white-label add-on ($39/mo). It's $138/month that unlocks unlimited client revenue.

**First 2 Weeks Are Critical:** Clients expect magic immediately. Schedule weekly check-ins, review missed questions, retrain the bot. After week three, it's autopilot. Ignore this, and clients churn fast.

**Upsell Goldmine:** Once the bot proves ROI, upsell lead scoring ($200/mo), custom integrations ($300/mo), or multi-language expansion ($150/mo per language). You're just flipping switches—ChatBase does the work.

**Real-World Wins:** 
- Wellness clinic: 60% drop in "when are you open?" emails (they were getting 100+/week)
- Law firm: Captured 15-20 after-hours leads monthly, converted 40% to consultations = 6-8 new cases
- SaaS company: Deflected 70% of Tier-1 support tickets, saved $4K/month in support costs

The platform works. The business model prints money. Just don't oversell and underdeliver in week one.

## The 3 Killer Features That Make ChatBase a Revenue Machine

### White-Label AI Support That's Actually Invisible

[FEATURE_START:right]
Your client's customers see YOUR brand, YOUR logo, YOUR colors. ChatBase disappears completely. The chatbot lives on their domain, matches their design system, and signs every message with their company name.

**Why This Matters:** One wellness agency rebranded ChatBase for a dental clinic. Within 60 days, the clinic asked to "expand the support team." They had no idea it was AI. The agency upsold them from $800/month to $1,400/month for "dedicated support hours." Same bot. Zero extra work.

You control everything: custom CSS, domain masking, branded email notifications. Clients think you built it from scratch. You're just reselling ChatBase at 500-800% markup.

### Lead Capture That Runs While You Sleep

[FEATURE_START:left]
Most chatbots answer questions and disappear. ChatBase captures emails, phone numbers, and qualifying questions—then routes hot leads straight to your client's CRM via Zapier, Make, or webhooks.

**Why This Matters:** A landscaping company was losing 15-20 quotes per month to after-hours calls (they close at 5 PM). ChatBase captured those leads automatically. They converted 40% into jobs—6-8 sales per month they would have missed. ROI was instant.

The magic is in the conditional logic. Set the bot to ask "What's your budget?" before capturing contact info. You can filter tire-kickers before they waste your client's time.

### 80+ Languages Without Hiring Translators

[FEATURE_START:right]
Upload documents in English. ChatBase auto-translates into 80+ languages—Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, Hindi—instantly. Your clients serve global customers without paying translation agencies or hiring multilingual support staff.

**Why This Matters:** A SaaS company had 30% of support tickets in Spanish and Portuguese. They were paying $2,500/month for bilingual support reps. ChatBase handled 70% of those tickets automatically. They cut support costs by $1,750/month while response times dropped from 4 hours to 4 seconds.

Best part? You charge clients $150-$300/month per additional language. ChatBase does it for free. Pure margin.

## How Agencies Actually Monetize ChatBase

### The Standard Reseller Model

You pay: **$138/month** (Standard plan $99 + White-label add-on $39)
You get: **2 white-labeled chatbots** (enough for 2 clients)

**Pricing Tiers You Can Charge:**

- **Basic Support Bot:** $500-$800/month (answers FAQs, captures leads, single language)
- **Pro Support + CRM Integration:** $1,000-$1,500/month (multi-language, Zapier integration, custom branding)
- **Enterprise Setup:** $2,000-$3,000/month (advanced lead scoring, API access, dedicated support)

**Real Example:** 5 clients at $800/month average = $4,000/month revenue. Your cost: $138/month base + $34.50/month per extra bot (5 bots total = $138 + $103.50 = $241.50). **Profit: $3,758/month.**

### The Upsell Path (Where Real Money Hides)

Once clients see ROI, stack these add-ons:

1. **Lead Scoring Module:** $200-$300/month (prioritize hot leads automatically)
2. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard:** $150-$250/month (track conversion rates, missed questions, peak hours)
3. **Custom Integrations:** $300-$500/month (connect to HubSpot, Salesforce, custom CRMs)
4. **Multi-Language Expansion:** $150-$300/month per language (Spanish, French, German, etc.)
5. **Voice-to-Chat Add-On:** $250-$400/month (answer phone calls, transcribe to chat)

**Most Profitable Client Type:** Local service businesses (lawyers, dentists, contractors) who lose $10K-$50K per missed lead. They'll pay $1,500-$2,500/month without blinking.

## ChatBase Pricing (What You Actually Pay)

| Plan | Price | Chatbots | Messages | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Free** | $0/mo | 1 | 30/month | Testing only (useless for clients) |
| **Hobby** | $19/mo | 2 | 2,000/month | Solo freelancers (not agencies) |
| **Standard** | $99/mo | 5 | 10,000/month | **Agencies (start here)** |
| **Unlimited** | $399/mo | 10 | 100,000/month | High-volume agencies (10+ clients) |
| **White-Label Add-On** | +$39/mo | Any plan | N/A | **Required for reselling** |

**What Agencies Should Buy:** Standard ($99) + White-Label ($39) = **$138/month** for 5 chatbots. Covers up to 5 clients. Add extra bots at $34.50/month each if you need more.

**AppSumo Trap:** Lifetime deal sounds great, but caps you at 5 total chatbots ever. No white-label option. Skip it—you'll outgrow it in month two.

## ChatBase vs. The Competition

| Feature | ChatBase | Intercom | Drift |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Pricing (Base)** | $138/mo (Standard + White-label) | $74/mo (starts here, scales fast) | $2,500/mo (minimum) |
| **White-Label** | ✅ Yes ($39/mo add-on) | ❌ No (Intercom branding always visible) | ❌ No (Drift branding locked) |
| **Setup Time** | 90 min (upload docs, embed widget) | 3-5 hours (complex setup, custom rules) | 4-6 hours (enterprise onboarding) |
| **GPT-4o Training** | ✅ Yes (built-in, no coding) | ❌ No (basic AI, limited customization) | ❌ No (rule-based, not true AI) |
| **Multi-Language** | ✅ 80+ languages (auto-translate) | ✅ Limited (manual translation only) | ❌ English only |
| **Lead Capture** | ✅ Yes (Zapier, webhooks, CRM integrations) | ✅ Yes (native CRM, but expensive tiers) | ✅ Yes (enterprise tier only) |
| **Best For** | **Agencies reselling to SMBs** | Mid-market SaaS (in-house support teams) | Enterprise sales teams (big budgets) |

**Bottom Line:** If you're reselling to local businesses (dentists, lawyers, contractors), ChatBase wins on price, setup speed, and white-label flexibility. Intercom and Drift are built for in-house teams with $50K/year budgets—not agencies marking up services.

## FAQs

**Q: Can I really charge $800/month for something that costs me $138/month?**  
A: Yes. You're not selling software—you're selling "24/7 support that captures leads your clients would've lost." Position it as a service, not a tool. Law firms and contractors pay $10K-$50K per missed lead. Charging $800/month to prevent that is a no-brainer.

**Q: What if clients ask too many questions and hit message limits?**  
A: Standard plan includes 10,000 messages/month (200/day average). If a client burns through that, upsell them to a "premium support tier" at $1,200/month and upgrade to Unlimited ($399/mo). You pocket the difference.

**Q: Do I need to code to set this up?**  
A: No. Upload a PDF, paste your website URL, customize colors, copy the embed code. Done. If you can use Canva, you can deploy ChatBase.

**Q: Can clients tell it's a chatbot?**  
A: GPT-4o is scarily good. Most users can't tell. If accuracy dips below 90%, retrain the bot (takes 10 minutes—upload updated FAQs or website content).

**Q: What's the fastest way to land the first client?**  
A: Target local service businesses with high lead value (lawyers, HVAC, roofing). Offer a "30-Day Lead Capture Audit"—deploy the bot for free, track missed leads, then show them the ROI. They'll sign a $800-$1,200/month contract on the spot.

**Q: Can I rebrand the chatbot interface completely?**  
A: Yes. Custom CSS, domain masking, branded email notifications. You control the entire UI. Clients think you built it from scratch.

## Limitations You Need to Know

1. **Free Tier is Useless:** 30 messages/month won't even cover one demo. Skip it entirely.
2. **AppSumo Deals Are a Trap:** Lifetime access sounds great, but you're capped at 5 total chatbots and no white-label option. You'll outgrow it immediately.
3. **First 2 Weeks Require Hand-Holding:** Clients expect magic on day one. Schedule weekly check-ins, review missed questions, retrain the bot. After week three, it's autopilot. Ignore this, and they churn.
4. **Message Limits Sneak Up Fast:** If a client has 500+ visitors/day, they'll burn through the Standard plan (10,000 messages/month). Monitor usage and upsell to Unlimited before they hit the wall.
5. **No Built-In Phone Support:** ChatBase is chat-only. If clients need phone call handling, you'll need to integrate with a voice-to-text tool (like Dialpad or Aircall) and charge extra for setup.

## The Verdict: Is ChatBase Worth It for Agencies?

**Rating: ★★★★★ 4.8/5**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ White-label flexibility (clients never see ChatBase branding)
- ✅ Fast setup (90 minutes to deploy, not 3-5 days like Intercom)
- ✅ High-margin reselling ($138/mo cost → $800-$1,500/mo revenue per client)
- ✅ Lead capture that actually works (Zapier, webhooks, CRM integrations)
- ✅ 80+ languages without hiring translators

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ Free tier is useless (skip it entirely)
- ⚠️ First 2 weeks require active training (not fully autopilot on day one)
- ⚠️ Message limits can creep up fast (monitor usage closely)

**Best For:** Agencies reselling AI support to local service businesses (lawyers, dentists, contractors, HVAC, roofing) who lose $10K-$50K per missed lead and will gladly pay $800-$2,500/month to fix that problem.

**Skip If:** You're a solo freelancer or only want one chatbot for your own site (Hobby plan at $19/mo is cheaper). ChatBase's real ROI unlocks when you resell it to multiple clients.

**Final Call:** If you're an agency looking to add $5K-$15K/month in recurring revenue without hiring support staff, ChatBase is the fastest path there. The white-label option and lead capture features are untouchable at this price point.
