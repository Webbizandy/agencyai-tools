# Prompts to Profits - Actual Content Summary

## Title & Subtitle
**Prompts to Profits**
*How to launch a Cash-Generating AI System in 30 Days — Without Code, Complexity, or Being an AI Expert!*

## Subtitle on page 2
*A Definitive Guide to Monetizing AI with the P.A.I.D Method™*

## What the book is ACTUALLY about:
- **NOT about prompts** - it's about building Custom GPTs that solve business problems
- About the **P.A.I.D Method™** for monetizing AI
- Building AI implementation tools (Custom GPTs) for businesses
- Finding expensive problems and building simple solutions
- The business side of AI, not the technical side

## The P.A.I.D Method™:
- **P - Position:** Find expensive problems businesses will pay to solve
- **A - Attract:** Systematically reach businesses that have those problems  
- **I - Implement:** Build simple Custom GPTs using the M.A.P.S. framework
- **D - Diversify:** Replicate and scale into partnerships and licensing

## Key Points:
1. The money isn't in the technology - it's in finding the right problem to solve
2. You can build a Custom GPT in an afternoon that solves a specific problem and charge $3K to $5K+ for it
3. No coding required, no AI expertise needed
4. Focus on **implementation**, not information
5. Build once, sell multiple times - monthly recurring revenue

## Two Major Markets:
1. **Local Service Businesses** - HVAC, roofers, lawyers, accountants, dentists
2. **Expert Market** - Course creators, coaches, consultants with IP trapped in courses

## Real Examples from the book:
- **Real Estate Agent (Jace)**: Built a Real Estate GPT Pack with 5 specialized tools, sold out in a week at $1,200 upfront + $100/month
- **Expert Market (James)**: Built AI Implementation Partners from course content to solve the "completion crisis" (only 15% of students finish courses)

## The shift:
Information became worthless. Implementation is what's valuable. Getting it DONE, applying it to YOUR specific situation.

## NOT about:
- Prompt engineering
- Writing prompts
- Prompt libraries
- Generic AI tools
