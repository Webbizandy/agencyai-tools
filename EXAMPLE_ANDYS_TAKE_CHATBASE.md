# ChatBase - Andy's Take (EXAMPLE)

## The Main Take (Goes right after hero section)

Look, I'll cut straight to it.

ChatBase is the tool that finally made me stop answering the same damn questions over and over again.

I've been running this for 12 agency clients now. Same setup every time - upload their docs, train it for 5 minutes, embed on their site. Done.

The best part? I charge $750/month per client for this. My cost? $99/month total for ALL of them.

Do the math... That's $9,000/month revenue on a $99/month cost.

ROI is stupid good.

Here's what actually works in practice:

**Client onboarding bots** - I trained one on my PAID Method book and old client SOPs. New clients ask it questions at 2am instead of waiting for me to wake up. Saves me about 10 hours a week of "How do I do X?" emails.

**Sales qualification** - Stuck one on my landing page asking prospects 3 questions before they book a call. Conversion went from 8% to 15% because only people who actually GET what I do are booking now.

**The white-label play** - This is where the real money is. Most agencies I know are charging between $500-$1,500/month per chatbot. You brand it as yours, deploy to clients, and it looks like you built custom AI for them.

Client thinks you're a genius. You're just using ChatBase and collecting monthly checks.

Thing is, it's not perfect...

The free tier is useless - 30 messages/month won't even get you through testing. And if your content is messy (random PDFs with no structure), the bot gives wonky answers.

But if you take 30 minutes to organize your docs properly before uploading? Works great.

I timed my last setup. 47 minutes from "I should build this" to "It's live on the client's site."

That's the kind of leverage I'm talking about.

No coding. No API wrestling. No developer charging you $5K to build something that breaks in a month.

## Quick Facts

**Bottom Line:**
Best white-label chatbot tool for agencies. Period. If you're doing websites or marketing for clients and NOT selling them this, you're leaving $500-1,500/month per client on the table.

**My Setup:**
Standard plan ($99/mo). All clients on one account. Train on 3 core docs per client: service overview, FAQ, case studies. Deploy same day. Charge $750/mo.

**Client Results:**
One dental client cut support emails by 80% in first month. Another B2B agency added $18K/month recurring revenue running chatbots for 12 clients on my $99 plan.

**Worth it if:**
You already have clients in web design, SEO, or marketing. This is the easiest upsell you'll ever make. "Your website gets traffic but visitors have questions. This answers them 24/7 and captures leads."

**Skip if:**
You're looking for complex automation workflows or appointment booking without integrations. ChatBase answers questions brilliantly but won't schedule meetings unless you add Zapier or Calendly into the mix.

## Writing Style Analysis

**What makes this sound like Andy:**

✅ Cuts straight to the point ("Look, I'll cut straight to it")
✅ Real numbers and specifics ("47 minutes" "$9,000/month" "12 clients")
✅ Casual Aussie phrases ("stupid good" "wonky answers" "damn questions")
✅ Vulnerable without weakness ("it's not perfect" but here's how I work around it)
✅ Specific client stories (dental client, B2B agency)
✅ Natural flow - longer sentences flow into shorter punch ("Do the math..." "ROI is stupid good.")
✅ One step ahead positioning ("Here's what actually works in practice")
✅ Self-deprecating humor ("Client thinks you're a genius. You're just using ChatBase...")

**NOT like corporate review:**
❌ No "leverage" or "optimize" corporate speak
❌ No generic "this is amazing" hype
❌ No rigid transitions like "Let me explain..."
❌ Specific names and real moments instead of "A client of mine..."
