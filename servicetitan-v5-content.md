# ServiceTitan Review 2025: The True Cost for Service Contractors ($300-$2,000+/mo)

## The $12,000/Month Question

Picture this: You're an HVAC contractor pulling in $75K/month. Your dispatcher uses a whiteboard. Your techs carry clipboards. Your invoices are handwritten.

A ServiceTitan rep walks in and says, "We can 3x your revenue."

You ask, "How much?"

They don't give you a number. They say, "Let's talk about your business."

That's ServiceTitan. No pricing on the website. No "starting at $X" button. Because the real question isn't "How much does it cost?" — it's "How much money are you leaving on the table without it?"

## Andy's Take

**Rating: ★★★★☆ 4.4/5**

ServiceTitan is the 800-pound gorilla in field service software. If you're selling AI services to HVAC companies, plumbers, electricians, or any contractor with trucks in the field — you need to understand this platform.

Here's why: Your prospects are either already using ServiceTitan, thinking about it, or should be. And when you can integrate your AI chatbots, lead capture tools, and automation *into* ServiceTitan? Your pitch becomes 10x easier.

**The reality:** ServiceTitan costs $300-$2,000+/month depending on company size, features, and number of users. Most small contractors ($500K-$1M revenue) pay around $500-$800/month. Mid-size shops ($1M-$5M) pay $1,200-$2,000/month.

**Is it worth it?** If you're a contractor doing $500K+/year and still using pen and paper, yes — you'll see ROI in 3-6 months. If you're under $300K/year, it's probably overkill (try Jobber or Housecall Pro instead).

**For agencies:** ServiceTitan doesn't sell white-label. But you can become a "ServiceTitan Partner" and get referral commissions. More importantly, if you sell AI chatbots, lead gen, or automation to service businesses, knowing how to integrate with ServiceTitan gives you a massive competitive edge.

**Who uses it?**
- HVAC companies (90% of large HVAC shops use ServiceTitan)
- Plumbing contractors

- Garage door, pest control, appliance repair, pool service

## The 3 Things ServiceTitan Does Better Than Everyone Else

[FEATURE_START:right]
### 1. The Mobile Experience (Why Techs Actually Use It)

Most CRMs are built for office people. ServiceTitan is built for people in trucks.

**The tech app lets you:**
- See today's jobs with customer history, past invoices, equipment photos
- Pull up the digital price book: "Water heater replacement? That's $2,400-$3,800 depending on unit."
- Present multiple service options to the customer (Good-Better-Best pricing)
- Take photos of the problem, add notes, generate estimate
- Collect payment on-site (card reader syncs to phone)
- Get the invoice emailed to customer before you leave the driveway

**Why this matters:** Your average plumber isn't going to log into a web app and enter data after hours. ServiceTitan's mobile UX is so good that techs actually use it — which means your data is accurate.

**For agencies:** If you're selling AI chatbots or lead capture tools, you can integrate directly with ServiceTitan's API. Leads flow straight into the dispatch board. That's a huge selling point.

### 2. The Price Book & Good-Better-Best Selling System

ServiceTitan doesn't just track jobs — it helps techs *sell more*.

**Here's how it works:**
- You load your entire price book into ServiceTitan (every service, every part, every labor rate)
- When a tech diagnoses a problem, they can present 3 options:
  - **Good:** Fix the immediate issue ($800)
  - **Better:** Fix + preventative maintenance ($1,400)
  - **Best:** Full system replacement with warranty ($4,200)

**The result?** Average ticket size goes up 30-60%.

**Example:** Plumber shows up for a clogged drain. Old way: Charge $150, leave. ServiceTitan way: "Your drain is clogged because tree roots are cracking the pipe. I can clear this for $150, but it'll clog again in 6 months. OR I can replace this section for $1,200 and you'll never have this problem again. Here's the photos."

Conversion rate on the upsell? 40-50% on average.

**Why agencies care:** If your client is using ServiceTitan, you can prove ROI on your AI chatbot by showing how many booked calls converted to $4,000+ jobs vs $150 quick fixes.

### 3. The Call Tracking & Booking Integration

ServiceTitan doesn't just manage jobs — it tracks *where those jobs came from*.

**Integrated call tracking:**
- Every phone number on your website gets a unique ServiceTitan tracking number
- Google Ads? Tracked. Facebook? Tracked. Your truck wrap? Tracked.
- When a call comes in, ServiceTitan logs it and (optionally) records it
- CSRs can book the job directly from the call screen

**AI chatbot integration (this is where agencies win):**
- Use ServiceTitan's API to push web leads directly into the dispatch board
- Customer fills out a chatbot form at 11 PM → Automatically creates a job in ServiceTitan → Dispatcher sees it at 7 AM
- No copy-paste, no missed leads, no "I thought you were calling them back"

**For AI agency owners:** This is your killer demo. Show an HVAC owner: "Right now, when someone fills out your website form at night, it goes to email and maybe gets called back in 3 days. With our AI chatbot + ServiceTitan integration, it's booked before your coffee gets cold."

## How Agencies Monetize ServiceTitan Knowledge

ServiceTitan doesn't have a white-label or reseller program like Vendasta or ChatBase. But there are 3 ways to make money:

### 1. Become a ServiceTitan Affiliate/Referral Partner

- Refer a contractor to ServiceTitan, get a commission (typically $500-$1,500 per closed deal)
- Not a recurring commission, but one-time payment
- Apply at: https://www.servicetitan.com/partners

### 2. Sell AI Chatbots + ServiceTitan Integration

**This is the real play.**

Most HVAC/plumbing companies have terrible websites with "Contact Us" forms that go to an email no one checks.

**Your offer:**
- "We'll add an AI chatbot to your website that qualifies leads and books appointments 24/7."
- "Every lead automatically flows into ServiceTitan so your dispatcher sees it first thing in the morning."
- Charge: $500-$1,500/mo per client
- Your cost: $50-$150/mo (ChatBase or similar)

**Why this works:** ServiceTitan contractors already *understand* tech ROI. They're paying $1,000+/mo for the CRM. They get it. Your pitch is easy.

### 3. Offer ServiceTitan Training & Optimization Consulting

Many contractors pay for ServiceTitan and use 20% of its features.

**Service you can sell:**
- "ServiceTitan Optimization Package" — $2,000-$5,000 one-time
- Audit their setup, build their price book, train their team
- Set up automated campaigns (review requests, maintenance reminders)
- Configure reporting dashboards

**Retainer model:**
- $500-$1,000/mo to manage their ServiceTitan marketing automation
- You run email/SMS campaigns, track ROI, optimize call tracking

**Who buys this?** Contractors doing $1M-$5M who are too busy to learn the platform themselves.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get ServiceTitan pricing without a sales call?

No. ServiceTitan requires a demo and quote. Expect a 30-45 minute sales call where they'll ask about your revenue, number of trucks, current tools, etc.

**Pro tip:** Be honest about your revenue. They won't sell to you if you're too small (under $300K/year). If you're below that, ask them to recommend Jobber or Housecall Pro — they'll respect the honesty.

### Does ServiceTitan have a free trial?

No free trial. They offer a **demo account** where you can click around, but you can't use it for real jobs.

### Is there a setup fee?

Yes. Onboarding costs $1,500-$8,000 depending on:
- How much data you're migrating (old CRM, QuickBooks, spreadsheets)
- How many users need training
- Whether you want custom integrations

### Can I use ServiceTitan if I'm a solo contractor?

Technically yes, but it's **massive overkill**. If you're a one-person show, use Jobber ($49/mo) or Housecall Pro ($49/mo) instead. ServiceTitan is built for teams.

### Does ServiceTitan integrate with QuickBooks?

Yes. Two-way sync with QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Desktop. Invoices, payments, and customer data flow automatically.

### Can I use ServiceTitan if I'm not HVAC/plumbing/electrical?

Officially, ServiceTitan is built for "residential field service contractors." In practice:
- ✅ Works great: HVAC, plumbing, electrical, garage doors, pest control, pool service, appliance repair
- ⚠️ Kinda works: General contractors, remodelers, landscapers (but better tools exist)
- ❌ Not a fit: Commercial construction, non-field service businesses

---

## Limitations & Drawbacks (The Honest Take)

### 1. **It's Expensive**

$500-$2,000/mo is a real budget commitment. For contractors under $500K/year, that's a big chunk of profit.

**Reality check:** If you're doing $300K/year and netting 10% profit ($30K), spending $6K-$10K/year on software is tough. You'll see ROI, but the upfront investment hurts.

**Alternative:** Start with Jobber ($49/mo), grow to $500K, *then* upgrade to ServiceTitan.

---

### 2. **Onboarding Is a Slog**

ServiceTitan is powerful, but setup takes 30-60 days and 20-40 hours of work. You need to:
- Migrate all your customer data
- Build your entire price book (every service, every part)
- Set up your call tracking numbers
- Train your entire team (office + field techs)

**What agencies need to know:** If you're selling ServiceTitan integrations, budget 10-15 hours for the API setup. It's not plug-and-play.

---

### 3. **Overkill for Small Shops**

If you're a solo plumber or a 2-person HVAC shop, ServiceTitan is like buying a semi-truck to deliver pizzas. It works, but it's ridiculous.

**Use case mismatch:**
- Solo contractor doing $200K/year → Use Jobber ($49/mo)
- 2-3 person team doing $300K-$500K → Use Housecall Pro ($169/mo)
- 5+ person team doing $500K+ → Now ServiceTitan makes sense

---

### 4. **No Month-to-Month Plans**

ServiceTitan requires annual contracts. You're locked in for 12 months minimum.

**Cancellation policy:** If you cancel mid-contract, you owe the remaining months. No prorated refunds.

---

### 5. **Sales Process Is Intense**

Getting pricing requires:
1. Fill out a form
2. Schedule a demo call (30-45 min)
3. Get a custom quote
4. Sign an annual contract

Some contractors find this annoying. If you just want to "try it for $99/mo," you'll be disappointed.

**Why they do this:** ServiceTitan's customers are $1M+ revenue businesses. They need implementation support, training, and account management. A self-serve free trial doesn't make sense at that level.

---

## The Verdict: Is ServiceTitan Worth It?

### ✅ ServiceTitan is worth it if:
- You're a field service contractor doing $500K+/year
- You have 5+ employees (techs, dispatchers, CSRs)
- You want to increase average ticket size (Good-Better-Best selling)
- You need sophisticated call tracking and marketing attribution
- You're serious about scaling to $1M-$10M+

### ❌ ServiceTitan is NOT worth it if:
- You're under $300K/year in revenue
- You're a solo contractor or 1-2 person team
- You just need basic job scheduling (use Jobber instead)
- You can't commit to 30-60 days of setup and training

### 🤝 For Agencies:
ServiceTitan knowledge is a **massive competitive advantage** if you sell to contractors.

**The play:**
1. Partner with ServiceTitan (referral program)
2. Sell AI chatbots with ServiceTitan integration
3. Offer ServiceTitan optimization consulting

**Reality:** Most marketing agencies don't understand field service businesses. If you can walk into an HVAC shop and say, "I know you're using ServiceTitan, here's how we integrate our lead capture tools with your dispatch board" — you'll close 3x more deals.

---

**Rating: ★★★★☆ 4.4/5**

**Best for:** Mid-large field service contractors ($500K+ revenue)  
**Avoid if:** You're a small contractor under $300K/year (try Jobber or Housecall Pro)  
**Agency play:** Master ServiceTitan integration for AI chatbots and lead capture tools  
**Cost reality:** $500-$2,000/mo + $2,000-$5,000 setup, but ROI is usually 1-3 months
