# Jobber Review 2025: The ServiceTitan Alternative for Small Contractors ($29-$349/mo)

## The $29/Month Game-Changer

A lawn care guy is sitting in his truck at 10 PM, writing tomorrow's invoices by hand.

His phone rings. It's a customer: "Can you squeeze me in tomorrow morning?"

He flips through his clipboard schedule. "Uh... I think I'm free at 11? Let me check my route and call you back."

He never calls back. The customer books someone else.

That's $400 gone. Because he doesn't have a $29/month Jobber account.

## Andy's Take

**Rating: ★★★★☆ 4.4/5**

Jobber is ServiceTitan for small contractors who aren't ready to spend $1,000+/month on software.

If you're a lawn care company, cleaning service, handyman, pest control, or any home service business doing under $500K/year, Jobber is the best CRM you can get for the money.

**The reality:** Jobber costs $29-$349/month depending on your team size and features. Most solo contractors pay $49-$79/mo. Teams of 3-5 pay $129-$169/mo. Larger operations ($500K+/year) pay $229-$349/mo.

**Is it worth it?** If you're still using pen and paper, YES — you'll see ROI in the first week. If you're using spreadsheets and email, YES — you'll book 20-30% more jobs just from faster response times. If you're already using ServiceTitan, NO — don't downgrade.

**For agencies:** Jobber has a **white-label reseller program**. You can rebrand it, resell it to your clients, and keep 20-30% of the monthly fee. Plus, Jobber's API makes it dead simple to integrate AI chatbots, lead capture tools, and automation.

## What Is Jobber?

Jobber is a CRM and business management platform built specifically for small home service contractors.

Think of it as ServiceTitan Lite — same core features (scheduling, invoicing, customer management) but simpler, cheaper, and faster to set up.

**Core functions:**
- **Scheduling & Dispatch:** Drag-and-drop calendar, route optimization, recurring job scheduling
- **Mobile App for Crews:** Clock in/out, view job details, collect payments, take photos
- **Customer Management:** CRM with notes, job history, automated follow-ups
- **Invoicing & Payments:** Generate invoices on-site, accept credit cards via mobile
- **Online Booking:** Customers can book and pay online (like Calendly for contractors)
- **Quoting:** Create and send estimates, track conversions
- **Reporting:** Revenue tracking, job profitability, customer lifetime value

**Who uses it?**
- Lawn care & landscaping (40% of Jobber's user base)
- Cleaning services (residential & commercial)
- Handyman & maintenance
- Pest control
- Pool service
- HVAC & plumbing (small shops under $300K/year)

**Who it's NOT for:**
- Large contractors doing $1M+/year (use ServiceTitan)
- General construction (use Buildertrend or Procore)
- Retail or non-field service businesses

## The 3 Things Jobber Does Better Than ServiceTitan

[FEATURE_START:right]
### 1. Setup Takes 1 Hour Instead of 1 Month

ServiceTitan requires 30-60 days of onboarding, data migration, and training. Jobber takes **1 hour**.

**Here's the setup process:**
1. Sign up (5 min)
2. Import your customer list from a spreadsheet (10 min)
3. Add your services and pricing (15 min)
4. Connect your payment processor (Stripe or Square, 5 min)
5. Download the mobile app and book your first job (10 min)

Done. You're operational.

**Why this matters:** Most small contractors don't have time to sit through 6 hours of training videos. Jobber is so intuitive that you can learn it while you're using it.

**For agencies:** If you're selling Jobber integration to small contractors, you can set them up in a single 90-minute call. Compare that to ServiceTitan's 6-week implementation timeline.

### 2. Online Booking Widget (Like Calendly for Contractors)

Jobber's killer feature: **customers can book and pay online without talking to you**.

**Here's how it works:**
- You embed a booking widget on your website
- Customer picks a service ("Lawn Mowing - $50"), chooses a date/time, enters their address
- Jobber checks your availability, shows open slots
- Customer books and pays instantly
- Job appears on your Jobber calendar

**The result?** You wake up to 3 pre-paid jobs already booked.

**Example:** A pressure washing company adds the Jobber widget to their website. Before: 10 leads/week, 6 book after 2-3 phone calls. After: 15 leads/week, 12 book instantly online. Conversion rate goes from 60% to 80%.

**Why agencies care:** If you're selling AI chatbots or lead capture tools, you can funnel leads straight to the Jobber booking widget. "Our chatbot qualifies them, Jobber books them, you show up and get paid."

### 3. Route Optimization (Stop Wasting Gas & Time)

Most small contractors plan routes by memory: "I'm in the north side Tuesday morning, so I'll squeeze that guy in."

Jobber automates it.

**Route optimization features:**
- View all jobs on a map
- Drag-and-drop to reorder stops
- Jobber suggests the most efficient route (saves 15-20 min/day)
- Send route to mobile app so crews know where to go next

**Real-world impact:** A lawn care crew doing 8 jobs/day saves 20 minutes in drive time. That's 1.5 hours/week. Over a season (April-October), that's 42 extra hours — enough for 21 more jobs at $50/each = $1,050 in extra revenue.

**For AI agency owners:** If you're building lead capture tools for home service businesses, you can show them: "We'll feed your Jobber calendar with pre-qualified leads, and Jobber will route your crew for maximum efficiency. More jobs, less windshield time."

## How Agencies Monetize Jobber

Unlike most SaaS tools, Jobber has a **white-label reseller program** designed for agencies.

### 1. Become a Jobber Affiliate (Easiest)

- Refer clients to Jobber, get $100-$200 per signup
- No ongoing commission, but no work required
- Sign up at: https://www.jobber.com/partners

### 2. Jobber White-Label Reseller Program (Best Play)

**This is the real moneymaker.**

- Jobber lets you rebrand their platform with your logo
- You resell it to your clients at whatever price you want
- You keep 20-30% of the monthly fee (negotiable based on volume)
- Jobber handles all support, updates, and infrastructure

**Example pricing:**
- Jobber wholesale: $50/mo
- Your price to clients: $75-$100/mo
- Your profit: $25-$50/mo per client

**Scale:** 20 clients = $500-$1,000/mo recurring revenue with zero technical work.

### 3. Sell AI Chatbots + Jobber Integration

**The winning combination:**

Most small contractors have terrible lead capture:
- Phone calls go to voicemail
- "Contact Us" forms go to email
- Customers don't get responses for 6-24 hours
- Booking rate is 40-60%

**Your offer:**
- "We'll add an AI chatbot to your website that qualifies leads and books appointments 24/7."
- "Leads automatically flow into Jobber so you wake up to a full calendar."
- Charge: $200-$500/mo per client
- Your cost: $50/mo (ChatBase) + $0/mo (Jobber API is free)

**Why this works:** Contractors already understand paying for tools (they pay $79-$169/mo for Jobber). Your chatbot is just another tool that makes them money.

### 4. Offer Jobber Setup & Management Consulting

Many contractors sign up for Jobber and use 30% of its features.

**Service you can sell:**
- "Jobber Setup & Optimization Package" — $500-$1,500 one-time
- Import their customer list, set up services/pricing, configure automation
- Train their team (30-60 min)
- Set up online booking widget on their website

**Retainer model:**
- $200-$500/mo to manage their Jobber account
- You handle automated emails, follow-up campaigns, reporting

**Who buys this?** Contractors doing $200K-$500K who are too busy to learn the platform.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Jobber have a free trial?

Yes. **14-day free trial**, no credit card required. Full access to all features on the Grow plan.

### Can I use Jobber if I'm a solo contractor?

Yes. The Core plan ($29/mo) is perfect for solo operators. You get scheduling, invoicing, mobile app, and online booking.

### Does Jobber integrate with QuickBooks?

Yes. Two-way sync with QuickBooks Online. Invoices, payments, and customer data sync automatically.

### Can customers book and pay online?

Yes. Online booking is included on all plans. Customers can book, pay, and get confirmation via email/SMS.

### Does Jobber have route optimization?

Yes, but only on the Grow plan ($169/mo) and higher. Core and Connect plans don't include route optimization.

### Can I white-label Jobber?

Yes, but only through the Jobber Partner Program. You need to apply and be approved. Typically requires 5+ clients before they'll approve white-label access.

### Does Jobber work offline?

Partially. The mobile app can view scheduled jobs offline, but you need internet to sync data, process payments, or update job details.

---

## Limitations & Drawbacks (The Honest Take)

### 1. **No Built-In Call Tracking**

Unlike ServiceTitan and Housecall Pro, Jobber doesn't have call tracking built-in. If you want to know which marketing channels drive phone calls, you need to use a 3rd-party tool like CallRail ($45/mo+).

**Workaround:** Use UTM parameters on web leads and manually ask phone callers "How did you hear about us?"

---

### 2. **Route Optimization Locked Behind $169/Mo Plan**

Route optimization is a HUGE time saver, but it's only available on Grow ($169/mo) or Manage ($349/mo). If you're on Core ($29/mo) or Connect ($79/mo), you're planning routes manually.

**Reality check:** If you have 2+ crews, pay for Grow. You'll save enough in gas and time to cover the cost.

---

### 3. **Limited Marketing Automation**

Jobber has basic automated emails (appointment reminders, follow-ups), but it's not a full marketing platform. No segmentation, no A/B testing, no advanced workflows.

**For agencies:** If you need sophisticated email marketing, connect Jobber to ActiveCampaign or Mailchimp via Zapier.

---

### 4. **Payment Processing Fees Are Standard (Not Discounted)**

Jobber uses Stripe and Square for payments. You pay standard rates:
- **2.9% + $0.30 per transaction** (card-present)
- **3.4% + $0.30 per transaction** (card-not-present)

Some competitors (like ServiceTitan) negotiate lower rates for high-volume users. Jobber doesn't.

**Reality:** If you're processing $50K/month, you're paying ~$1,500/mo in fees. That's industry-standard, but not discounted.

---

### 5. **Not Ideal for Large Operations ($1M+/Year)**

If you're doing $1M+/year with 10+ trucks, Jobber starts feeling limiting. You'll want ServiceTitan's advanced reporting, call tracking, and marketing attribution tools.

**Use case mismatch:**
- Under $500K/year → Jobber is perfect
- $500K-$1M → Jobber works, but you'll start eyeing ServiceTitan
- Over $1M → Upgrade to ServiceTitan

---

## The Verdict: Is Jobber Worth It?

### ✅ Jobber is worth it if:
- You're a home service contractor doing $100K-$500K/year
- You want simple, fast setup (1 hour vs 30 days)
- You need online booking to capture after-hours leads
- You're tired of pen-and-paper scheduling
- You're an agency looking for a white-label CRM to resell

### ❌ Jobber is NOT worth it if:
- You're doing $1M+/year and need ServiceTitan's advanced features
- You need built-in call tracking (use Housecall Pro instead)
- You're a general contractor (use Buildertrend or Procore)
- You don't go to customers' locations (Jobber is for field service only)

### 🤝 For Agencies:
Jobber is one of the few SaaS tools with a real **white-label reseller program**. If you sell to home service businesses, this is a no-brainer:

**The play:**
1. Join Jobber Partner Program (white-label reseller)
2. Sell AI chatbots with Jobber integration
3. Offer Jobber setup & management as a service

**Reality:** Most agencies don't know Jobber exists. If you walk into a cleaning company and say, "We can set you up with a white-label CRM for $99/mo plus an AI chatbot for $299/mo" — you'll close the deal in one meeting.

---

**Rating: ★★★★☆ 4.4/5**

**Best for:** Small home service contractors ($100K-$500K revenue)  
**Avoid if:** You're doing $1M+/year (upgrade to ServiceTitan)  
**Agency play:** White-label reseller program + AI chatbot integration  
**Cost reality:** $29-$349/mo, most pay $79-$169/mo, 1-hour setup
