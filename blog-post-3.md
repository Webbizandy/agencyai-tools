# Top White-Label AI Tools You Can Resell (And Actually Make Money)

Three months ago, I watched an agency owner charge a client $997/month for a chatbot he built using a $97/month white-label tool.

The client was thrilled. The agency owner pocketed $900/month in profit. Everyone won.

That's the beauty of white-label AI tools. You get to be the hero without building the technology yourself.

But here's the catch: Not all white-label tools are created equal. Some are garbage with a "rebrand" sticker slapped on top.

I've tested 30+ white-label AI platforms over the past year. Most of them? Not worth your time.

But a few? Absolute gold mines.

## What Makes a Good White-Label AI Tool

Before I show you the list, let's talk about what actually matters when you're reselling AI tools.

### 1. It Has to Actually Work

Sounds obvious, right? But you'd be shocked how many "AI-powered" tools are just glorified chatbots with pre-written responses.

Your clients will figure it out fast. And when they do, they'll cancel and tell everyone you sold them garbage.

Test the tool yourself first. Use it for your own business. If it doesn't work for you, it won't work for your clients.

### 2. The White-Label Has to Be Complete

Some platforms let you change the logo and call it "white-label."

That's not white-label. That's lazy.

Real white-label means:
- Custom domain (youragency.com, not theirtool.com/youragency)
- Your branding everywhere (no "Powered by..." footers)
- Client-facing dashboards with your logo and colors
- Email notifications from your domain

If clients can tell you're reselling someone else's tool, it's not truly white-label.

### 3. The Economics Have to Make Sense

Here's the math that matters:

**Your cost** (what you pay the platform) + **Your time** (setup and support) = **Your total cost**

**Client price** (what you charge) - **Your total cost** = **Your profit**

If your profit per client is less than $300/month, it's not worth it. You're better off selling something else.

Aim for 3x-10x markup. That's the sweet spot.

### 4. Support Has to Be Solid

When your client's chatbot breaks at 3am, they're calling you, not the white-label platform.

So you need a platform with:
- Fast support response times (under 4 hours)
- Good documentation you can reference
- A community or Slack channel for troubleshooting

If the platform's support sucks, your life will suck.

## The White-Label Tools Worth Reselling

Alright, here's what's actually working right now.

### 1. ChatBase (White-Label AI Chatbots)

This is the one I use most. Dead simple to set up, actually works, and clients love it.

**What you get:**
- Fully white-labeled chatbot builder
- Custom domain support
- Client dashboards with your branding
- API access for custom integrations

**Your cost:** $99/month for white-label access (unlimited chatbots)

**What to charge:** $497-$997/month per client

**Best for:** Service businesses (HVAC, contractors, dentists) who need 24/7 lead capture

**Andy's note:** I've got 12 clients on this right now. That's $6K/month in recurring revenue for something that takes me 2 hours a month to manage.

### 2. GoHighLevel (All-in-One Agency Platform)

If you want to offer the full stack—CRM, email, SMS, funnels, websites, calendars—this is it.

**What you get:**
- Complete white-label platform
- Your own branded SaaS product
- Client management dashboard
- Unlimited sub-accounts

**Your cost:** $497/month for agency account (unlimited clients)

**What to charge:** $297-$997/month per client

**Best for:** Agencies selling to service businesses who need everything in one place

**Andy's note:** The margins are insane. Charge clients $297/month, pay $497/month total, and you're profitable at 2 clients. Everything after that is pure profit.

### 3. Instantly.ai (White-Label Cold Email)

Cold email still works if you do it right. Instantly makes it easy to resell.

**What you get:**
- White-label email outreach platform
- Unlimited email accounts
- Deliverability optimization
- Client dashboards

**Your cost:** $97/month for white-label access

**What to charge:** $497-$1,497/month per client (depending on volume)

**Best for:** B2B agencies or clients who need consistent lead flow

**Andy's note:** The deliverability features are legit. I've run campaigns with 60%+ open rates, which is unheard of in cold email.

### 4. Vendasta (White-Label Marketing Platform)

This is the enterprise option. More expensive, but if you're targeting bigger clients, it's worth it.

**What you get:**
- White-label marketplace of 200+ tools
- Reputation management, social media, SEO, and more
- Client reporting dashboards
- Reseller support

**Your cost:** Varies by tools used (typically $200-$500/month per client)

**What to charge:** $1,000-$3,000/month per client

**Best for:** Agencies with bigger clients who need comprehensive marketing solutions

**Andy's note:** The learning curve is steep, but once you're set up, you can offer a full marketing suite without building anything yourself.

### 5. Synthesia (White-Label AI Video)

Video content is exploding. Synthesia lets you create AI-generated videos with custom avatars.

**What you get:**
- White-label video creation platform
- Custom AI avatars
- Multi-language support
- API access

**Your cost:** $1,000/month for white-label access

**What to charge:** $2,000-$5,000/month per client (or per-video pricing)

**Best for:** Agencies creating training videos, explainer videos, or content at scale

**Andy's note:** The cost is high, but so is the perceived value. Clients see AI video as "cutting-edge" and are willing to pay premium prices.

## How to Actually Sell White-Label AI Tools

Having the tools is one thing. Selling them is another.

Here's the framework I use:

### Step 1: Pick One Tool and One Market

Don't try to sell everything to everyone. You'll confuse yourself and your prospects.

Pick one tool (like ChatBase) and one market (like HVAC companies).

Master that combination first. Then expand.

### Step 2: Build One Case Study

You need proof before you can sell at scale.

Find one client willing to try it at a discount (or even free for the first month).

Document everything:
- The problem they had
- How you solved it
- The results they got (in numbers)

That case study is worth more than any sales pitch.

### Step 3: Package It as Your Product

Don't say "I'm reselling ChatBase." Say "I built a custom AI chatbot platform for HVAC companies."

Position it as YOUR solution, not someone else's tool.

Your branding. Your positioning. Your pricing.

### Step 4: Charge What It's Worth

Don't race to the bottom on price. Service businesses have money. They just need to see the value.

If you're saving them 10 hours a week or capturing 20 extra leads a month, $997/month is a no-brainer.

Price for value, not cost.

## The Mistake Most Agencies Make

They try to resell too many tools at once.

ChatBase AND GoHighLevel AND Instantly AND Vendasta AND Synthesia.

That's five different platforms to learn, five different support systems to manage, and five different ways to confuse your clients.

Start with one. Get 10 clients on it. Then add the next one.

That's how you build a real white-label business instead of a chaotic mess.

## What to Do Next

Pick one tool from this list. The one that fits your target market best.

Sign up for the white-label access. Test it yourself for a week.

Then find one client who needs it. Build that case study.

Use that case study to sell the next 10 clients.

That's how you build a six-figure white-label AI business in the next 12 months.
