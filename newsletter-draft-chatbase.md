## Email Body

Hey [First Name],

Most agency owners are grinding themselves into the ground trading hours for dollars.

Client calls, support tickets, onboarding questions, "quick favors"...

You know the drill.

Here's a better way.

### The White-Label Revenue Model

One agency is running 25 client chatbots on a single $99/month tool.

They charge each client $750/month.

**That's $18,750 in monthly revenue on a $99 cost.**

Not consulting. Not custom development. Not hours traded for dollars.

Just smart positioning.

### Here's How It Works

The tool is ChatBase - an AI chatbot builder that turns docs and website content into instant customer support.

But here's the move:

**You don't sell them ChatBase.**

You sell them a custom AI assistant with YOUR branding. They think you built something special.

Behind the scenes? ChatBase backend. Your setup time: 1-2 hours per client.

### The Math That Actually Works

- **Your cost:** $19-$99/month total (covers ALL your clients, not per client)
- **Setup time:** 1-2 hours per client (one-time)
- **What you charge:** $500-$1,500/month per client
- **Maintenance:** 30 minutes per week reviewing responses

**Example with 10 clients:**
- Cost to you: $99/month
- Revenue: $7,500/month (at $750/client)
- Profit: $7,401/month
- Time investment after setup: 5 hours/week

That's $89,000+ in annual profit from a service that mostly runs itself.

### Why Clients Actually Buy This

Your clients are drowning in support requests:

- "How do I reset my password?"
- "What are your hours?"
- "How do I access X feature?"

Same 20 questions, different day.

A chatbot handles 80% of this automatically, 24/7.

**For them, it's:**
- Fewer support tickets
- Happier customers (instant answers)
- More time for actual business

**For you, it's:**
- Recurring revenue
- Minimal maintenance
- Easy upsell to existing clients

### The 5-Minute Setup

1. Upload client docs (PDFs, URLs, FAQs)
2. Train the bot (2-5 minutes)
3. Customize with their branding
4. Embed on their website
5. Monitor and refine

No coding. No developers. No API wrestling.

### Who This Works For

**Perfect if you're:**
- Already serving clients (web design, SEO, marketing)
- Looking for recurring revenue
- Tired of trading hours for dollars

**Not for you if:**
- You need complex workflows without integrations
- You're hoping for "set it and forget it" (needs weekly reviews first month)
- You want AppSumo lifetime deals (too many restrictions)

### The White-Label Add-On

Standard plan: $99/month
- 2 AI agents (2 clients)
- 12,000 messages/month
- White-label available (+$39/month)

For agencies, you want:
- Standard plan + white-label = $138/month
- Covers 2 fully-branded client chatbots
- Scale up as you add more clients

### Real Talk: The Limitations

**It won't:**
- Handle complex workflows (like booking appointments) without extra integrations
- Be "truly unlimited" (there are message limits)
- Work well on the free tier (only 100 messages/month)

**You still need to:**
- Review conversations weekly (first month)
- Fine-tune responses based on client feedback
- Organize content properly before upload

### Internal Use First

Before selling to clients, use it internally:

1. **Client onboarding bot** - Upload your onboarding docs, answer common questions automatically
2. **Team knowledge base** - SOPs, processes, "how do I do X?" answered instantly
3. **Sales qualifier** - Pre-qualify leads on your website before they book a call

This proves it works AND gives you case study material for pitching clients.

### The Pitch to Clients

Don't lead with "chatbot."

Lead with the problem:

*"I noticed your support team is answering the same 20 questions all day. What if we handled 80% of those automatically so they can focus on the complex stuff?"*

Then show them:
- Instant 24/7 support
- Their branding (not a generic bot)
- Lead capture built-in
- Multi-language support (if relevant)

### Multi-Language Goldmine

One bot, 80+ languages automatically.

If your clients have international customers, this is a massive selling point.

No extra work. No additional setup. Just works.

### Lead Capture Feature

The bot can require an email before answering questions.

**For you:** Build email lists for clients while providing support
**For them:** Turn support into lead generation

Win-win.

### Integration Options

Works with:
- Websites (simple embed)
- Slack (internal team use)
- WhatsApp (customer support)
- Zapier (connect to CRM, email tools, etc.)
- Messenger (Facebook)

This lets you position it for different use cases depending on the client.

### Ongoing Maintenance (The Real Work)

**First Month:**
- Review conversations weekly
- Adjust responses based on what people actually ask
- Add missing content to knowledge base
- Fine-tune personality/tone

**After Month One:**
- Review monthly
- Update when client's products/services change
- Add seasonal FAQs as needed

Time commitment: 30 minutes per client per week (first month), then ~10 minutes/month.

### Pricing Tiers for Clients

**Entry Level:** $500/month
- Basic setup
- Standard responses
- Monthly reviews

**Standard:** $750/month
- Custom personality/tone
- Lead capture setup
- Bi-weekly reviews

**Premium:** $1,500/month
- Multi-language support
- Advanced integrations (Zapier workflows)
- Weekly optimization
- Custom reporting

Start everyone at Standard. Upsell Premium to clients with complex needs or international reach.

### The Expansion Play

Once a client has a chatbot:

**Upsell opportunities:**
- Additional bots for different departments
- Advanced integrations (CRM, booking systems)
- Custom reporting/analytics
- Chatbot optimization services

One client becomes 3-5 revenue streams.

### Technical Reality Check

**Strengths:**
- Setup is genuinely fast
- AI models understand context (GPT-4o available)
- White-label works well
- Multi-language actually works

**Weaknesses:**
- Not truly "unlimited" (message limits exist)
- AppSumo deals have feature restrictions
- Can't handle complex workflows alone
- Needs periodic refinement

### The 7 Mistakes That Kill This Business Model

**Mistake 1: Selling on the free tier**

You'll hit message limits in week one and look unprofessional.

**Fix:** Start on Standard plan. $99/month is nothing compared to first client's payment.

**Mistake 2: Not building your own bot first**

Clients smell BS when you're pitching something you don't use.

**Fix:** Use it internally for 2 weeks before selling. You'll find issues AND have real answers.

**Mistake 3: Pricing too low**

$300/month "to be competitive" → clients don't see value → high churn.

**Fix:** Minimum $500/month. If they can't afford that, they're not your client.

**Mistake 4: Set-and-forget mentality**

"I'll just upload their FAQs and it'll be perfect."

It won't.

**Fix:** Review first 50 conversations with the client. Fix gaps. Show them you're optimizing.

**Mistake 5: Selling to broke businesses**

Small local businesses that "think they need this" but have 10 support tickets per month.

**Fix:** Qualify hard. 100+ tickets/month minimum. If they don't have the problem, don't create it.

**Mistake 6: Leading with "AI chatbot"**

"We sell AI chatbots" → "Oh like those annoying popup things?"

**Fix:** Lead with their problem. "I help e-commerce brands handle support without hiring more people."

**Mistake 7: Using ChatBase branding**

Even with white-label, if you say "powered by ChatBase," you're training clients to go direct.

**Fix:** Your brand only. Custom domain. Your name. They never need to know the backend.

### The AppSumo Warning

Skip the lifetime deals.

Users report:
- Locked out of newer AI models
- Restricted features
- Limited support

Go monthly. The $99/month Standard plan is the agency sweet spot.

### The Content Organization Checklist (Setup Quality)

Garbage in = garbage out.

Before setting up a client bot, organize content this way:

**1. Core Documents (Must-have):**
- [ ] FAQs (formatted Q&A style)
- [ ] Product/service descriptions
- [ ] Pricing information
- [ ] Contact information
- [ ] Hours of operation
- [ ] Return/refund policies

**2. Training Content (Quality boost):**
- [ ] Common support ticket responses
- [ ] Onboarding guides
- [ ] "How to" articles
- [ ] Product comparison docs
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides

**3. Personality Guide (Brand consistency):**
- [ ] Brand voice guidelines
- [ ] Example conversations
- [ ] Tone preferences (formal vs casual)
- [ ] Words to avoid
- [ ] Phrases to use

**4. Escalation Rules (Critical):**
- [ ] When to hand off to human
- [ ] Who to escalate to
- [ ] What questions need human review
- [ ] Emergency contact protocols

**5. Prohibited Topics (Legal protection):**
- [ ] Medical/legal advice boundaries
- [ ] Financial advice limitations
- [ ] What bot CANNOT answer
- [ ] Disclaimer requirements

Spend 2 hours organizing this before 30 minutes uploading randomly.

Your bot will be 10x better.

### The Client Closing System (Your $18K Roadmap)

Most people fail here. They build a great bot but can't close clients.

Here's the exact closing system one agency uses to land 80% of prospects:

**Step 1: Qualify Before You Pitch (5 minutes)**

Ask these questions before spending time on a demo:
- "How many support tickets do you handle monthly?"
- "What percentage are repeat questions?"
- "What's your average response time right now?"
- "Do you have FAQs/docs we could use?"

**If they say:**
- 100+ tickets/month → Qualified lead
- 50-100 tickets/month → Maybe (depends on ticket value)
- Under 50 tickets/month → Too small (politely pass)

**Step 2: The 10-Minute Demo That Closes**

Don't show them ChatBase.

Show them THEIR bot (that you built in 20 minutes):

1. **Before the call:** Take 20 minutes to build a basic bot using their website content
2. **Start the demo:** "I took 20 minutes this morning and built something for you..."
3. **Let them ask it questions:** Handover = ownership
4. **Show them the conversations:** Transparency builds trust
5. **Walk through embedding:** "This goes live in 5 minutes"

**The magic moment:** When they ask their bot a question and it answers correctly using their own content.

That's when they go from "interesting" to "how fast can we start?"

**Step 3: Handle the Three Common Objections**

**Objection 1: "We already have live chat"**

Response: *"Perfect. This handles the 80% of questions that are wasting your team's time. Your live chat team focuses on the 20% that actually need a human. You're not replacing them—you're making them more effective."*

**Objection 2: "What if it gives wrong answers?"**

Response: *"Great question. That's why we review every conversation the first month and tune responses. After that first month, accuracy is typically 95%+. Plus, you can see every conversation—total transparency. And if someone needs a human, they get escalated immediately."*

**Objection 3: "We don't have budget right now"**

Response: *"I get it. Quick question—how much time does your team spend answering the same questions every week? [Wait for answer] At $X per hour, that's $Y per month. This saves that time and costs $750/month. Actually saves you money."*

Then pause. Let them do the math.

**Step 4: The Trial Close That Actually Works**

Don't say: *"Want to think about it?"*

Say: *"I've got time next Tuesday to get your bot live. Want me to block 90 minutes?"*

You're not asking if they want it. You're asking when they want it.

**Step 5: The Follow-Up That Seals Deals**

If they don't commit on the call, send this email 2 hours later:

---

**Subject:** Quick recording from our call + your bot link

Hi [Name],

Great talking earlier. Here's the bot we built for you: [LINK]

Feel free to test it out—ask it anything your customers typically ask.

I put together a quick Loom walking through:
- How to embed it (5 minutes)
- How to review conversations
- What happens when it needs to escalate to a human

[LOOM LINK]

I blocked Tuesday at 2pm to get you live if you want to move forward. Just reply "yes" and I'll send over the agreement.

If you want to pass, no worries—just let me know so I can free up that time.

[Your Name]

---

**Why this works:**
- They have a working bot (removes risk)
- You've done the work (shows commitment)
- There's a deadline (creates urgency)
- Easy to say yes (just reply)

**Step 6: The Pricing Conversation**

Never lead with pricing. Lead with results.

But when they ask, here's the script:

*"We have three options:*

*Basic at $500/month—handles your FAQs, reviews monthly.*

*Standard at $750/month—what I'd recommend for you. Custom personality, lead capture, reviewed bi-weekly.*

*Premium at $1,500/month—for teams doing international support or needing advanced integrations.*

*Based on what you told me about [specific pain point], Standard makes the most sense. Want to start there?"*

Then stop talking. First person who speaks loses.

**Step 7: The Onboarding That Prevents Churn**

First 48 hours are critical:

**Hour 1:** Send welcome email with clear next steps
**Hour 4:** Schedule 30-minute content gathering call
**Day 2:** Deliver working bot with their branding
**Day 3:** Review first 50 conversations together
**Week 1:** Daily check-ins (5 minutes each)
**Week 2:** Three check-ins
**Week 3-4:** Weekly check-ins

After month one, move to monthly reviews.

Clients who see results in the first week don't churn.

**Step 8: The Expansion Close (Where Real Money Is)**

After 60 days, when the bot is proven, pitch expansion:

*"Your sales bot is crushing it—handling 200+ conversations monthly. I'm seeing opportunities for two more:*

*1. Internal HR bot - handles employee questions about PTO, benefits, policies*
*2. Product specialist bot - deep dive on your premium product line*

*Each bot is $500/month. Would add $1,000 to your monthly, and saves your team probably 20+ hours per month.*

*Want me to build demos this week?"*

One client becomes three bots = $2,250/month instead of $750/month.

**The Real Closing Numbers**

If you pitch 10 qualified prospects using this system:
- **8 will take a demo** (because you pre-built their bot)
- **6 will move to trial** (because it's low-risk)
- **4-5 will convert to paying** (because they see results)

That's a 40-50% close rate.

Industry average for agency services? 10-20%.

**Why This System Works**

1. **You do the work first** - No "trust me" selling
2. **They experience it** - Seeing is believing
3. **Low friction** - Easy yeses at every step
4. **Clear timeline** - No endless "thinking about it"
5. **Risk reversal** - They see results before paying

### Getting Started This Week

**Day 1:** Sign up for Standard plan + white-label ($138/month)

**Day 2:** Build internal chatbot for your agency
- Upload your onboarding docs
- Test with team members
- Refine responses

**Day 3:** Create pitch deck for existing clients
- Focus on support burden
- Show time savings
- Include pricing options

**Day 4:** Build demo bots for 3 prospects BEFORE reaching out
- Use their website content
- Test thoroughly
- Make sure it answers their top 10 FAQs

**Day 5:** Pitch 3 existing clients using the demo bot system
- Send personalized video with link to THEIR bot
- "I built this for you in 20 minutes..."
- Book demo calls for the same week

**Day 6-7:** Run demos, close deals, onboard first clients

### The Numbers Again

- **10 clients at $750/month:** $7,500 revenue
- **Your cost:** $138/month (Standard + white-label)
- **Profit:** $7,362/month
- **Annual profit:** $88,344

That's a six-figure profit center from a service that mostly runs itself after the first month.

### Real Agency Case Studies (The Proof)

**Case Study 1: The Web Design Agency**

Started with 0 chatbot clients. Now at 18 clients = $13,500/month.

**What they did:**
- Emailed existing 50 clients: "We're adding AI support bots—want to be in the first 10?"
- Offered first 10 clients 50% off month one ($375 instead of $750)
- Got 12 responses, closed 8 in first 2 weeks
- Added 10 more over next 2 months through referrals

**Their secret:**
- Only pitched clients with 100+ monthly support tickets
- Built demo bot BEFORE sales call
- Showed their own internal bot as proof it works

**Time investment:**
- Week 1-4: 40 hours total (setup + refinement)
- Month 2+: 10 hours per month (reviews + optimization)

**Revenue:**
- Month 1: $3,000 (8 clients at $375 discounted)
- Month 2: $9,750 (8 at full price + 5 new clients)
- Month 3: $13,500 (18 clients at $750)

**Case Study 2: The SEO Agency**

Positioned chatbots as "conversion rate optimization" and charges $1,200/month.

**What they did differently:**
- Bundled bot setup with SEO retainer (existing clients)
- Focused on e-commerce clients with product questions
- Tracked conversion lift (showed 8-15% increase)
- Used conversion lift to justify premium pricing

**Their clients:**
- All e-commerce businesses
- $1M+ annual revenue
- 20+ products with detailed specs
- International customers (multi-language was key)

**Results:**
- 12 clients at $1,200/month = $14,400 monthly
- Cost: $99/month (didn't need white-label - branded as "SEO support package")
- Profit: $14,301/month

**Why they charge more:**
- Track ROI (conversions, not just support tickets saved)
- Premium clients (e-commerce vs small business)
- Positioned as revenue generator, not cost saver

**Case Study 3: The Solo Consultant**

Built to $7,500/month in 90 days as a one-person operation.

**What they did:**
- Started with own consulting website
- Used it to reduce client onboarding questions
- Pitched it to 3 consulting clients
- Got 2 yeses, used those as case studies
- Posted case study on LinkedIn
- Got 8 inbound leads from post
- Closed 5 more clients

**Their numbers:**
- 10 clients at $750/month = $7,500
- Time: 15 hours per month total (all clients combined)
- Effective hourly rate: $500/hour
- Previous consulting rate: $200/hour

**Key insight:**
"I make more money managing 10 chatbots than I did doing custom consulting at $200/hour. And I get my evenings back."

### Who's Doing This Already

**Web design agencies:** Adding recurring revenue to one-time projects

**SEO agencies:** Positioning it as "customer experience optimization"

**Marketing agencies:** Bundling with lead generation services

**Solo consultants:** Replacing hours-for-dollars with scalable service

**Virtual assistant agencies:** Offering "AI assistant" instead of human VAs

They're all selling the same backend tool with different branding and positioning.

The market doesn't care about the tool. They care about solving their problem.

### The Bottom Line

This isn't about ChatBase specifically.

It's about the model:

1. Find a solid tool with white-label options
2. Brand it as your own service
3. Charge 10-20x what you pay
4. Deliver real value to clients
5. Scale without adding team members

ChatBase just happens to be one of the easiest to execute right now.

**The opportunity:**
- Low cost ($138/month)
- High margin (90%+ profit)
- Real client value (80% reduction in support tickets)
- Minimal maintenance (after first month)

**The catch:**
- You still need to do the work (setup, refinement, client management)
- Not passive income (despite what the gurus say)
- Requires organized content (garbage in, garbage out)

### Next Steps

If this sounds like your kind of play:

1. [Try ChatBase Standard + White-Label](https://www.chatbase.co/?via=andy-kelly) ($138/month)
2. Build your internal bot first (proof of concept)
3. Pitch 3 existing clients this week
4. Set up first paying client
5. Use their results to pitch the next ones

Or don't.

Keep trading hours for dollars while someone else in your market figures this out first.

Your call.

P.S. The agencies making $18K+ monthly from this aren't on the free tier. They're not using lifetime deals. They're on the Standard plan, charging premium prices, and delivering actual results. That's the move.
