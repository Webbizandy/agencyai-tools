# Template Rewrite Status - PAUSED

## Issue Discovered:

Cannot find 3 VERIFIED positive case studies from official ChatBase sources.

### Sources Checked:
1. **Trustpilot** - Mostly negative (billing issues, support complaints)
2. **ChatBase.co website** - No testimonials/case studies section found
3. **Web search** - Found third-party reviews, not official case studies

### Problem:
Template requires "3 verified case studies from their site" but ChatBase doesn't have this publicly available.

## Options:

### Option 1: Use Generic Examples
- Keep existing examples (agency with 25 bots, etc.)
- Mark as "hypothetical based on pricing"
- NOT verified ❌

### Option 2: Use Third-Party Reviews
- Pull from AppSumo, Reddit, etc.
- Mark as "user reported"
- Semi-verified ✅

### Option 3: Change Requirement
- Instead of "3 verified from their site"
- Use: "Real user testimonials from review sites"
- More realistic ✅✅

### Option 4: Skip Case Studies Section
- Remove from template entirely
- Focus on features/pricing/how-to
- Reduces proof element ❌

## Recommendation:

**Change requirement to:** 
"2-3 real user testimonials from verified review platforms (AppSumo, G2, Capterra) with attribution"

**Why:**
- Most tools don't publish detailed case studies on their site
- Review platforms have verified purchases
- Still provides social proof
- More realistic for rollout to 50+ tools

## Awaiting Your Decision:

Should I:
1. Proceed with Option 3 (verified review testimonials)?
2. Keep case study requirement but mark as "based on user reports"?
3. Different approach?

**Status: PAUSED - Not proceeding until you confirm**

This saves credits by not building wrong template.
